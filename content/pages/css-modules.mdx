[CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) are one of the most common methods to style React applications. Because they consist of plain CSS, they are easily understandable.

CSS Modules achieve what is referred to as **_weak scoping_**. Although styles are scoped to their respective components, they can be overridden by external styles. Depending on how you use this property, this is what makes CSS Modules so useful.

The usual approach to styling components using CSS Modules looks something like this:

The CSS is written in a `.module.css` file, and target class names.

```css
/* Component.module.css */
.component {
  property-1: 'value-1';
  property-2: 'value-2';
}
```

These classes are then imported as a JS object – usually given the name `styles`. The imported object is has the class names defined in the `.module.css` file as keys.

```tsx
// Component.tsx
import styles from './Component.module.css'

export const Component: React.FC = ({ children }) => (
  <div className={styles.component}>{children}</div>
)
```

```tsx
// index.tsx
import { Component } from './Component'

export const ParentComponent: React.VFC = () => (
  <Component>Some Content</Component>
)
```

That's all well and good. But what if you want to be able to adjust the styles from **outside** the component? Now things start to get tricky.

Fortunately, CSS Module imports are regular JavaScript objects. That means we can manipulate them as we usually would. One possible manipulation that is especially useful for us is **_string indexing[^1]_**. It allows us to choose which style to apply based on a string input.

If we apply _string indexing_ to the previous example, we get the following:

```css
/* Component.module.css */
.variant-1 {
  property-1: 'value-1-1';
  property-2: 'value-2-1';
}

.variant-2 {
  property-1: 'value-1-2';
  property-2: 'value-2-2';
}

.variant-3 {
  property-1: 'value-1-3';
  property-2: 'value-2-3';
}
```

```tsx
// Component.tsx
import styles from './Component.module.css'

type ComponentProps = {
  variant: '1' | '2' | '3'
}

export const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ children, variant }) => (
  <div className={styles[`variant-${variant}`]}>{children}</div>
)
```

```tsx
// index.tsx
import { Component } from './Component'

export const ParentComponent: React.VFC = () => (
  <Component variant="1">Some Content</Component>
)
```

We now have the ability to change the styling of the component through one of its props.

But why stop there? What about styling through **multiple** props?

It is possible, and can be achieved through **_string concatenation[^2]_**. Applied to our example, it looks like so:

```css
/* Component.module.css */
.property1-1 {
  property-1: 'value-1-1';
}
.property2-1 {
  property-2: 'value-2-1';
}

.property1-2 {
  property-1: 'value-1-2';
}
.property2-2 {
  property-2: 'value-2-2';
}

.property1-3 {
  property-1: 'value-1-3';
}
.property2-3 {
  property-2: 'value-2-3';
}
```

```tsx
// Component.tsx
import styles from './Component.module.css'

type ComponentProps = {
  property1: '1' | '2' | '3'
  property2: '1' | '2' | '3'
}

export const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({
  children,
  property1,
  property2,
}) => (
  <div
    className={[
      styles[`property1-${property1}`],
      styles[`property1-${property2}`],
    ].join(' ')}
  >
    {children}
  </div>
)
```

```tsx
// index.tsx
import { Component } from './Component'

export const ParentComponent: React.VFC = () => (
  <Component property1="2" property2="3">
    Some Content
  </Component>
)
```

If distilling all component styling into props feels too limiting, there exists a solution. It is possible to give a component custom styles by passing it a `className` prop:

```css
/* Component.module.css */

/* omitted for brevity — same as the above example */
```

```tsx
// Component.tsx
import styles from './Component.module.css'

type ComponentProps = {
  property1: '1' | '2' | '3'
  property2: '1' | '2' | '3'
  className?: string
}

export const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({
  children,
  property1,
  property2,
  className,
}) => (
  <div
    className={[
      styles[`property1-${property1}`],
      styles[`property1-${property2}`],
      className,
    ].join(' ')}
  >
    {children}
  </div>
)
```

```tsx
// index.tsx
import styles from './ParentComponent.module.css'

import { Component } from './Component'

export const ParentComponent: React.VFC = () => (
  <Component property1="2" property2="3" className={styles.component}>
    Some Content
  </Component>
)
```

One thing to look out for is the whitespace as the argument of `.join()`. Without it, the class names would be concatenated into one long name which the browser cannot recognise. Adding the space separates the class names into recognisable tokens.

Notice how have full control over how fine-grain the control should be? While the first example only had one prop (the `variant`), the second had a prop for each individual style property (`property1` and `property2`). The ability to choose the level of abstraction can be useful in many situations, such as architecting a design system.
