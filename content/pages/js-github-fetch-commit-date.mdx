description: How to fetch the date of a commit from the GitHub API
---

For an entire repository:

```ts
const response = await fetch(
  'https://api.github.com/repos/[user]/[repo]/commits'
)
const commits = await response.json()
const latestCommit = commits[0]
const latestCommitDate = latestCommit.commit.author.date
```

For a specific file within a repository:

```ts
const response = await fetch(
  'https://api.github.com/repos/[user]/[repo]/commits?path=[pathToFile]'
)
const commits = await response.json()
const latestCommit = commits[0]
const latestCommitDate = latestCommit.commit.author.date
```
