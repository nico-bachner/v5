title: CSS Margin Collapse
description: When Margins in CSS Collapse, and When They Don't
---

## TLDR

- **Do** collapse:
  1. **Vertical** stacking
  2. **Flow** layout
  3. Elements adjacent in the DOM
  4. Nested elements
  5. Positive values **or** negative values
- **Don't** collapse:
  1. **Horizontal** stacking
  2. **Flex**, **Grid**, and **Positioned** layout
  3. Elements **not** adjacent in the DOM
  4. Nested elements **inside a parent with padding or border**
  5. Positive values **and** negative values

## General Rule

Margins in CSS overlap when placed next to each other. For example, a 12px margin next to a 12px margin will add up to 12px of space (12px + 12px = 12px), while a 12px margin and a 6px margin will add up to 12px as well (12px + 6px = 12px). This is because the largest margin is used.

## Exceptions

There are notable exceptions to the rule, where margins don't collapse, but rather add up (instead of 12px + 12px = 12px, we get 12px + 12px = 24px)

1. Vertical margins collapse, Horizontal margins don’t.
2. Margins **only collapse in _flow layout[^1]_**. This means they do not collapse in flex or grid layouts.
3. Margins **only collapse if the elements are next to each other**. Elements such as a line break (`<br>`) will cause the margins to be counted separately.
4. Nested elements **will** collapse by default, but don't when the containing element has padding, a border, or an explicit height larger than its contents.
5. Positive values collapse, negative values collapse, but positive and negative values together do not collapse – they are added together.

[^1]: **Flow Layout**: when `display` is either `inline`, `block`, or `inline-block`.
