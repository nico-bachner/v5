SOS School ia a student initiative with the goal of helping primary school children in Luxembourg in their scholarly endeavours following the COVID-19 lockdowns.

Being a co-founder of the initiative, I took on multiple roles and responsabilities within the project:

-   [Organiser](#organiser)
-   [Volunteer](#volunteer)
-   [Webmaster](#webmaster)

## Organiser

## Volunteer

As a volunteer, I was responsible for two children. They were living in a refugee housing complex, and were referred to us by [Caritas Luxembourg](https://www.caritas.lu), who leads most of the humanitarian aid efforts in Luxembourg.

Both children were primarily experiencing difficulties with mathematics, so that is the subject I assisted them with the most. The assistence I provided was in form of weekly study sessions, where I helped them with whichever academic subject help was needed the most pressing.

When I arrived, they were bored with the material they were learning at school, part because they thought it was uninteresting, part because they found it too difficult. This had lead to a vicious cycle, so I had to begin with finding a way to break it. I struggled with this problem initially, since it was strongly self-reinforcing. However, I soon realised the key was to establish a personal connection with the aspiring scholars. Once they got to know me better personally, they were more eager to participate. From then, I strived to include fun in the learning process as much as possible, sparking their creativity by showing them the possibilities and wonders of mathematics in addition to the proposed curriculum.

## Webmaster

Being the only code literate person in our team, it was my responsability to create and maintain the project homepage, [www.sos-school.org](https://www.sos-school.org).

Because I was still relatively new to Web Development at the beginning of the project, I spent a lot of time experimenting in order to see what works. Once I started gaining experience, I was able to make better decisions, which often led to me taking two steps back and completely rethinking the architecture of the site.

After countless iterations, I have arrived at something that I feel fulfills the requirements of the site. The final tech stack is [React](https://reactjs.org), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), and it leverages Next.js' inbuilt [internationalised routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing) to make the page accessible to the panoply of ethnicities of the People of Luxembourg.

The source code for the site can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/sos-school/sos-school).
