## Command Propt

Instead of MacOS Spotlight, I use [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com), an application that significantly improves upon the concept of a command prompt, with **loads of built-in features** and **installable extensions** to add even more.

## Browser

My main browser is the MacOS default browser, [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/). Despite its bad reputation, it's **good-looking** and it works well with _Keychain_, Apple's built-in password manager, so there is **no need to use a 3rd party password manager**.

During development, I also test on [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) and [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

## Text Editor

My daily driver is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). Not only do I use VS Code for code, but I also write pretty much everything else in there. In comparison to word processors such as Microsoft Word, VS Code doesn't allow you to format text as such, which leaves me with one less opportunity to procrastinate.

VS Code also has an **amazing ecosystem of extensions**. Those I use are listed in my [Mac Setup](/mac-setup) process.

## Code Hosting

I host all of my code on [GitHub](https://github.com). All of my code repositories are **public** and **open source**. I also use private GitHub repositories as a **backup for personal projects**, such as essays, etc.

## Deployment

All of my web-based projects are deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Being the creators and maintainers of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), their platform is **specifically designed to host Next.js applications**, but they also support vanilla web hosting, [other frameworks](https://vercel.com/new/templates), and even [other languages](https://vercel.com/docs/serverless-functions/supported-languages). They also offer a [generous free tier](https://vercel.com/pricing), which is an added bonus.

## Terminal

I use the default MacOS Terminal. Many people use [iTerm](https://iterm2.com), but I prefer the default terminal. MacOS ships with it, and it serves its purpose. End of story.

In terms of Terminal configuration, I set the font to be Fira Code (12pt) to make [Starship](#shell-prompt) render properly.

## Shell

My default shell is the [Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com). The **syntax highlighting** is nice, and the **inbuilt autocompletion** is a killer feature. Fish also comes with a few other small improvements, such as mapping `..` to `cd ..`.

I also have my eye on [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh), a really promising project. It reimagines some parts of the traditional shell, such as `ls` output, which is structured in Nu, making it **easy to sort and filter**. However, it's less known, so the tab completion is a bit lacking.

## Shell Prompt

As a shell prompt, I use [Starship](https://starship.rs). It's cool because it **shows information relevant to the current directory**, such as:

- Name of current directory
- Git branch (& status)
- Node.js version
- Time the last command took to execute

Starship is also a **cross-shell** prompt, so it integrates smoothly with both Fish and Nu.

## Package Manager

When it comes to installing stuff. I use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), the go-to package manager for MacOS. It's great because it simply just works.

## Fonts

[Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) is my go-to sans-serif font. I came across Inter because [Vercel](https://vercel.com) uses it for their interfaces, and I really enjoy the **clean look and feel** of [their design system](https://vercel.com/design).

For code (monospace), I use [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) because of the **awesome ligatures** it ships with. I have it enabled both in VS Code and in the default MacOS terminal.
