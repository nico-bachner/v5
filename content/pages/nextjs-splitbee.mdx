[Splitbee](https://splitbee.io) is a free and open-source analytics tool that helps you understand your users and improve your website. It's a great alternative to Google Analytics and other paid analytics tools. I have been using it for a while now and I am really happy with it.

This guide is an extension and update of the [Splitbee Next.js Proxy Documentation](https://splitbee.io/docs/nextjs-proxy). I have added the [Next.js Script Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/script) to the guide, along with a few more quality-of-life improvements.

First, we need to make use of [Next.js Rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/rewrites) to point the local payload url to the Splitbee server.

```js
// next.config.js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/bee.js',
        destination: 'https://cdn.splitbee.io/sb.js',
      },
      {
        source: '/_hive/:slug',
        destination: 'https://hive.splitbee.io/:slug',
      },
    ]
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

Next, we add a script tag that imports the Splitbee code. As per the [original documentation](https://splitbee.io/docs/nextjs-proxy#2-adapt-the-splitbee-script-tag):

> `data-api` sets the endpoint for all tracking calls. We are using `/_hive` in this example.
>
> `src` needs to point to the Splitbee JS file that is proxied through your servers. We are using `/bee.js` in this example. Feel free to adapt those paths & filenames.

We can abstract the logic into an Analytics component.

```tsx
// components/Analytics.tsx
import Script from 'next/script'

export const Analytics: React.FC = () =>
  typeof window != 'undefined' &&
  window.location.href.includes('[site_url]') ? (
    <Script src="/bee.js" data-api="/_hive" strategy="afterInteractive" />
  ) : null
```

Replace `[site_url]` in `window.location.href.includes('[site_url]')` with the name of your production deployment domain. This will prevent errors from popping up in the console during development.

You can also adjust the strategy attribute according to your needs (view the [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/script#strategy) for the available options). However, in most cases, you should stick to `"afterInteractive"`.

Now all that remains is to import the Analytics component into the application â€“ ideally in `_app.tsx` to avoid duplication.

```tsx
// pages/_app.tsx
import { Analytics } from 'components/Analytics'

import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'

const App: React.FC<AppProps> = ({ Component, pageProps }) => (
  <>
    <Analytics />
    <Component {...pageProps} />
  </>
)

export default App
```
